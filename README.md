# React Formik Learning Project

This is a small web application built to learn, practice, and demonstrate key concepts of the powerful `Formik` library for form management in React. The main goal is to implement forms in a clean, maintainable, and efficient way.

This project was developed as part of my personal learning path to master modern tools within the React ecosystem.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Concepts Implemented

This project explores and utilizes the following `Formik` concepts:

-   **Basic Form Structure:** Using the core components: `<Formik>`, `<Form>`, `<Field>`, and `<ErrorMessage>`.
-   **Form State Management:** Handling `initialValues` and user input.
-   **Validation:**
    -   Implementing manual validation using the `validate` function.
    -   **(In Progress):** Refactoring to schema-based validation with the **Yup** library.
-   **Submission Handling:** Managing the `onSubmit` event to access final form data.
-   **User Feedback:** Dynamically displaying validation error messages for each field.
-   **Submission State:** Using the `isSubmitting` prop to provide visual feedback to the user during form submission (e.g., disabling the submit button).

## üéØ Learning Goals & Future Improvements

This project is a living document and will be continuously updated to incorporate new concepts. The roadmap for future improvements includes:

-   [ ] **Complete Yup Integration:** Fully refactor the validation logic using `Yup` for better readability and maintainability.
-   [ ] **Create Reusable Input Components:** Build custom, reusable components (e.g., `MyTextInput`) with the `useField` hook to reduce code duplication (DRY principle).
-   [ ] **Implement `<FieldArray>`:** Add a dynamic form where users can add or remove fields (e.g., a list of skills or friends).
-   [ ] **Explore the `useFormik` Hook:** Refactor a form using the `useFormik` hook to understand its use cases and benefits.
-   [ ] **Enhance UI/UX:** Improve the overall styling and user experience of the application.
